# Components library

This repo is a playground for me to work on building out a components library.

Three components were created as a workshop solution to [Josh Comeau's CSS for JavaScript Developers course](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js).

These styled components were created to resemble this [beautiful Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/u0wCdLXheiN9f2FmAuPsE9/Mini-Component-Library). They feature:

- A progress bar that is built without the HTML progress tag 
- A select that is styled to be attractive, but still use the native select for the sake of platform/device friendlineesss
- A text input that allows a leading icon as a parameter

The plan for this repo is to build out many more components as I find inspiration to progress my skills in React and styled-components.
